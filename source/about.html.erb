        <p>As a full-stack developer, I'm always looking for my next challenge, source of inspiration, and cool new tool to implement.<br>I was a high school teacher for four years before I decided to move across the world and pursue software development. I love building things (especially good software), experimenting with new challenges, and taking high(-ly calculated) risks- I believe this makes me a stronger developer.<br> Because of my background and experience in education, communication, and community advocacy, learning and growing, personally and professionally mean everything to me.<br>Above all else, I am looking to grow as a developer, always, and willing to travel or relocate for the right team.</p>
        <p>Also, I have a not-so-secret love for writing and documenting everything. A good idea always starts on paper, I think. Check out some of my writings <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://medium.com/@gabriela.preiss" id="medium-link">here</a></strong>.</p>
